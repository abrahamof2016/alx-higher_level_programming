# Python - Object-relational Mapping (ORM)

# Project Overview

This project delves into the exciting realm where Python's versatility meets the structured world of databases! I'll embark on a two-part adventure:

### * part 1: Raw SQL with MySQLdb

I'll establish a connection to a MySQL database using the MySQLdb module, a python library.
I'll gain hands-on experience executing essential SQL queries for retrieving (SELECT) and inserting (INSERT) data from MySQL tables.

### * part 2: Abstraction with SQLALchemy

I'll embrace the magic of SQLAlchemy, an ORM that empowers me to interact with databases seamlessly using Python classes and objects.
Say goodbye to writing raw SQL! SQLAlchemy, my focus shifts to the functionality of my objects, not the intricacies of database storage.  This not only simplifies code but also makes it adaptable to different database backends (e.g., switching from MySQL to PostgreSQL).
